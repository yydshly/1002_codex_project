# sprite-gen documentation index

One CLI, two sprite pipelines, independent tool groups and optional scene creation.
Each doc owns one concern. Start with the result you want, then follow its contract;
the code domains describe ownership rather than an execution order.

| Pipeline / tool group / workflow | Entry doc | Verbs |
|---|---|---|
| **A · atlas rows** — one still becomes a runtime sprite sheet | [run-contract.md](run-contract.md) | `prepare` → `gen` / `gen-set` → `extract` → `compose-atlas`; optional `curation` and recompose |
| **B · video → loop** — one still becomes transparent motion loops | [video-pipeline.md](video-pipeline.md) | `video-canvas` → `video` → `video-frames` → `video-loop`, `video-set`, `video-cycle-align` |
| **C · utilities** — imported images in, clean cuts out | [sheet-slicing.md](sheet-slicing.md) | `cutout`, `slice-sheet`, `unpack-atlas` |
| **D · post-processing** — finished sheets, refined | [recolor.md](recolor.md) | `recolor`, `recolor-palette`, `compose-layers`, breathing (compose), `export-pngs`, `export-aseprite` |
| **E · asset tools** — independent background, shadow and motion tools | [asset-tools.md](asset-tools.md) | `background-tile`, `shadow`, `inspect-motion` |
| **S · scene** — optional composition of existing assets | [scene.md](scene.md) | `scene-render`, `scene-inspect` |

`sprite-gen --help` prints these separate catalogs and every verb grouped by domain; the
grouping is derived from `sprite_gen/_modules.py`, the one taxonomy table.
